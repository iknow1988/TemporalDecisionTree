# Temporal Decision Tree

Time has been included in learning procedure in input domains where observations are recorded on a time basis. However, most recent works take input as a stream of events from the same entity. In those scenarios where a cohort of entities have a short event history, applying existing methods will lead to an isolated or inaccurate (if not both) prediction model for each entity. To address this problem, feedback-directed bottom-up approach is used to build the decision tree instead of using static entropy as splitting metric in the training process. This work adopts a probabilistic model based on Bayesâ€™ theorem to enhance prediction accuracy. However, to guarantee the solution, current processes use ad hoc process to find the best temporal decision tree creating a lot of unnecessary temporary intermediate trees that is very time consuming and even unable to process large datasets. In this paper we tried to prove a hypothesis to select the attribute efficiently to skip unnecessary creation of temporary trees. At the same time we also tried to find the common subsets of entropy calculation and save it to use in a table for future reference.
